## Introduction
"Penguins-Project", or "Projet CY-Fish", is an assignment given by both Eva ANSERMIN and Romuald GRIGNON, two teachers of mine at CY Tech.<br>
This assignment was due at the end of the second semester of my first year there.<br>
[See the assignment requirements](https://github.com/sofiansr/Penguins-Project/blob/main/P1_Info2_Project_CY-FISH_v1.0.pdf)

## How to play ?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure your keyboard is set to AZERTY before playing.

- Start the game : `.\NFS_Penguins`

- Press `P` to start a game, or `ESC` to quit.

- You need between 2 and 6 players to play the game.

- The game will ask for each players's username.

The game share pinguins between players based on this chart :
| Number of players | Number of pinguins per player |
| :-------- | :------- |
| 2 | 4 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 2 |
| 5 | 1 |
| 6 | 1 |

- The game will then display the grid, consisting of icebergs with fishes on them, and penguins on icebergs. 

- All penguins will spawn randomly on the grid.

You can now play by following these rules :
- The player who collects the most fish with his penguins wins the game.
- **Turn-by-turn**, each player will have to make a move, by choosing a direction **for one** of his penguins, and by choosing a distance (1 or more icebergs, admitting there is no penguins on an iceberg between start and destination). You can preview your move before doing it. 
- An iceberg can only be occupied **by one penguin at a time**. A penguin **cannot cross** an iceberg occupied by another penguin.
- Due to global warming, when a penguin leaves an iceberg, the latter will melt. You can't go on a melted iceberg.
- Players can collect fishes by moving on an iceberg with fishes. Depending on the number of fishes on this iceberg, the player's score will change.
- If a player cannot move any of their penguins on the grid (i.e stuck because all icebergs around them is melted), their turn is skipped until the end of the game.
- The game ends when all players are stuck.

Everything else is explained in game.
